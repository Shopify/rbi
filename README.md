# RBI generation framework

testing 

`RBI` provides a Ruby API to compose Ruby interface files consumed by Sorbet.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rbi'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rbi

## Usage

```rb
require "rbi"

rbi = RBI::File.new(strictness: "true") do |file|
  file << RBI::Module.new("Foo") do |mod|
    mod << RBI::Method.new("foo")
  end
end

puts rbi.string
```

will produce:

```rb
# typed: true

module Foo
  def foo; end
end
```

## Features

* RBI generation API
* RBI parsing with Whitequark
* RBI formatting
* RBI validation
* RBI merging

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

This repo uses itself (`rbi`) to retrieve and generate gem RBIs. You can run `dev rbi` to update local gem RBIs with RBIs from the central repo.
